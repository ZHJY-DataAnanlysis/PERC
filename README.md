The EduMix-24 and EduMath-24 datasets are specialized collections of educational resources designed for the task of automatic educational content classification.
Here are their key characteristics:

    Source: They were sourced from a real-world intelligent education platform, meaning the data is authentic and reflects modern digital learning materials.

    Composition: Together, they consist of 18,799 individual educational resources. These resources could include items like lesson plans, video lectures, interactive exercises, homework assignments, or presentation slides.

    Annotation: A crucial feature is that all resources have been manually annotated by human experts. This ensures high-quality labels for training and evaluating machine learning models.

    Classification Tasks: The resources are labeled across three distinct classification tasks:

        9 Lesson Types: Categorizing the overall structure or goal of the lesson (e.g., Practice class, Self-study class, Cooperative class).

        15 Teaching Modes: Identifying the primary instructional method used (e.g., Single-point teaching, Heuristic teaching,  Debate teaching).

        9 Activity Elements: Labeling the specific interactive components within the resource (e.g., Identify (A1), Understand (A2), Apply (A3)).

MSDS is collected for handwriting identity verification. Specifically, the MSDS-ChS subset could be exploited in online/offline Chinese signature verification, and the MSDS-TDS subset is intended to be used in online/offline identity verification with Token Digit Strings. In addition, MSDS can be exploited in writer identification.

Experimental results show all models perform better on MSDS-TDS than MSDS-ChS. This finding is inspiring that the accuracy of TDS verification is higher than that of Chinese signature verification as the two subsets were collected simultaneously. Therefore, Token Digit String could be a more effective biometric trait than Chinese signature for high-accurate online verification.
